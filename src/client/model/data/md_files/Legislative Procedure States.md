# Article 196: Provisions as to introduction and passing of Bills

## or simply: How Bills are Introduced and Passed

1. **Where Bills Start**: Bills (proposals for new laws) can start in either House of the Legislature in a State that has two Houses, except for Money Bills and financial Bills, which have special rules.

2. **Agreement by Both Houses**: For a Bill to be officially passed in a State with two Houses, both Houses must agree on it. They may agree to it as is or with changes both Houses approve.

3. **Bills Don’t Expire Due to Breaks**: If a Bill is being discussed and the House takes a break (prorogation), the Bill doesn’t expire. It stays on the table for future discussion.

4. **Effect of Assembly Dissolution**: If a Bill is in the second House (Legislative Council) and the Assembly is dissolved, the Bill doesn’t lapse. But if a Bill is in the Assembly or waiting for approval by the Council, it will lapse if the Assembly is dissolved.

# Article 197: Limits on Powers of Legislative Council for Non-Money Bills

## or simply: The Role of the Legislative Council in Passing Non-Money Bills

1. **Rejection or Delay**: If the Legislative Council (second House) rejects a Bill or doesn't pass it within three months, or if it suggests changes that the Assembly (first House) disagrees with, the Assembly can pass the Bill again in the same or future session and send it back to the Council.

2. **Final Decision After Second Time**: If the Council rejects the Bill again or doesn’t pass it within one month, the Bill will be considered as passed by both Houses in the form that the Assembly approved the second time.

3. **Not for Money Bills**: These rules don’t apply to Money Bills, which have different procedures.

# Article 198: Special Procedure for Money Bills

## or simply: How Money Bills Are Handled

1. **Only in Assembly**: Money Bills can only be introduced in the Legislative Assembly, not in the Legislative Council.

2. **Council’s Role**: After the Assembly passes a Money Bill, it is sent to the Council for recommendations. The Council must return it within 14 days, but the Assembly can accept or reject any of its recommendations.

3. **Final Approval**: If the Assembly accepts the recommendations, the Money Bill is passed with those changes. If not, the original form of the Bill (as passed by the Assembly) is considered passed by both Houses.

4. **Automatic Passing**: If the Council doesn’t return the Bill within 14 days, it is automatically considered passed in the form approved by the Assembly.

# Article 199: Definition of “Money Bills"

## or simply: What Counts as a Money Bill?

1. **Money-Related Issues**: A Bill is considered a Money Bill if it deals only with matters like taxes, borrowing money, state funds, spending from state funds, or anything connected to these financial matters.

2. **Not Just Any Fine or Fee**: A Bill isn't a Money Bill just because it involves fines, penalties, or fees. It must focus on bigger financial issues, not small local taxes or payments.

3. **Speaker’s Final Say**: If there's a question about whether a Bill is a Money Bill, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly decides, and their decision is final.

4. **Certification**: Every Money Bill must be officially certified by the Speaker before being sent to the Council or Governor.

# Article 200: Assent to Bills

## or simply: Governor’s Role in Signing Bills

1. **Governor’s Decision**: After a Bill is passed by the Assembly (or both Houses in States with two Houses), it goes to the Governor, who can either sign it into law, withhold approval, or send it to the President for consideration.

2. **Governor’s Request for Changes**: If the Bill isn’t a Money Bill, the Governor can send it back with suggestions for changes. The Assembly or both Houses will reconsider it, and if they pass it again (with or without changes), the Governor must then sign it into law.

3. **High Court Powers**: The Governor cannot approve any Bill that weakens the powers of the High Court. Such a Bill must be sent to the President for approval.

# Article 201: Bills Reserved for President’s Consideration

## or simply: President’s Role in Special Bills

1. **President’s Decision**: When the Governor sends a Bill to the President for approval, the President can either sign it into law or withhold approval.

2. **Returning Non-Money Bills**: For Bills that aren't Money Bills, the President can send them back with suggestions for changes, similar to what the Governor can do. The Legislature must reconsider it within six months. If they pass it again (with or without changes), the Bill is presented again to the President for a final decision.
