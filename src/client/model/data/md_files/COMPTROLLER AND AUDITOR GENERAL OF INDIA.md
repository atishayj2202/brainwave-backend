# Article 148. Comptroller and Auditor-General of India
## or simply: Who is the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG)?

(1) The Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG) is an important official who is responsible for auditing government finances. The CAG is appointed by the President of India, and the process for their removal is the same as for a Supreme Court judge, meaning it is difficult to remove them from office.

(2) Before taking up their duties, the CAG must swear an oath of office in front of the President or a designated person.

(3) The salary and working conditions of the CAG are decided by Parliament. Until Parliament sets these conditions, the rules listed in the Second Schedule of the Constitution apply. Importantly, after the CAG is appointed, their salary, leave, pension, or retirement age cannot be changed in a way that harms them.

(4) After their term, the CAG cannot take up any other job in the central or state government.

(5) The working conditions for staff in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and the CAG's administrative powers are determined by rules set by the President in consultation with the CAG, unless Parliament passes a law on the matter.

(6) The expenses of running the CAG’s office, including salaries and pensions, are paid from the Consolidated Fund of India, meaning they come from the government’s main account.

## or simply: What the CAG does

The CAG is responsible for auditing the finances of the central government, state governments, and any other government bodies as specified by Parliament. Until Parliament makes laws specifying the CAG's duties, the CAG will continue to perform the same tasks that the Auditor-General of India did before the Constitution was enacted. This includes auditing the finances of the central and state governments as was done during British rule.
