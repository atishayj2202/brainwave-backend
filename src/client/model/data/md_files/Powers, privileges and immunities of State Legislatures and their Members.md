## or simply: Powers and Privileges of State Legislators and Committees

1. **Freedom of Speech in the Legislature**: Members of a State’s Legislature have the right to speak freely in the House. This is protected by the Constitution, but it must follow the rules of procedure set by the Legislature.

2. **Protection from Legal Action**: No member can be sued or taken to court for anything they say or any vote they cast during the meetings of the Legislature or its committees. This protection also extends to the publication of any official reports, papers, or votes made by the authority of the Legislature.

3. **Powers and Privileges**: The powers, privileges, and legal immunities of the Legislature, its members, and committees will be defined by laws made by the Legislature. Until such laws are made, they will continue to have the same privileges as they did before the 44th Amendment of 1978.

4. **Rights of Non-Members**: Non-members who have a right to participate in the Legislature’s discussions or committees (as allowed by the Constitution) also enjoy the same privileges and protections as the members of the Legislature.
