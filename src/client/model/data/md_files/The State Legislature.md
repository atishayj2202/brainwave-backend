# Article 169: Abolition or Creation of Legislative Councils in States

## or simply: Changing the Number of Legislative Houses

Parliament can either set up a new Legislative Council in a State that doesn’t have one or abolish the existing Council in a State that has one. Here’s how it works:

- **Creating or Abolishing a Council**: The State’s Legislative Assembly needs to pass a resolution (a formal decision) to create or abolish a Legislative Council. This resolution must be approved by:
  - A majority of all the Assembly members, and
  - At least two-thirds of the members who are present and voting.

- **Law and Constitution**: The law to create or abolish the Council will include any necessary changes to the Constitution but won't count as an amendment to the Constitution under Article 368, which is usually about big changes to the Constitution.

# Article 170: Composition of the Legislative Assemblies

## or simply: Number of Members in State Assemblies

Each State’s Legislative Assembly must have between 60 and 500 members who are directly elected from different regions. Here’s how it works:

- **Number of Members**: The exact number of members depends on the State’s population and must be within the range of 60 to 500.

- **Equal Representation**: Each State is divided into regions called constituencies. The idea is to make sure that each constituency has a similar ratio of population to the number of seats. 

- **Census and Updates**: Every time a census is completed, the number of seats and the boundaries of constituencies are updated. However, these changes only take effect when the current Legislative Assembly is dissolved. Until then, elections are held based on the old boundaries. Also, changes based on the 2026 census won’t be made until those results are published.
